API Changes:
- Moved aochat event handling out of Main.php and in to AOChat.php
- Added third optional parameter $header (bol TRUE/FALSE) to makeBlob displaying VhaBot like terminal header. Shamelessly borrowed from VhaBot. Defaults to TRUE
- Added fourth optional parameter $strip (bol TRUE/FALSE) to chatCommand to allow stripping of all formatting for the actual link. This allows custom formatting of links. Defaults to FALSE.
- Added sixth optional parameter $strip (bol TRUE/FALSE) to makeItem to allow stripping of all formatting for the actual link. This allows custom formatting of links. Defaults to FALSE.
- chatCommand() now allows / as $origin parameter and will not prefix the chatCommand in any way.
- Added this->bot->core("tools")->myRand($min=false, $max=false) wrapper to call random number generator.
- Removed one optional parameter from getSite leaving the parameters now as: url, $strip_headers = FALSE, $read_timeout = FALSE.
  Only $url is a required parameter.
- AOChat now utilizes the Symfony Event Dispatcher for it's events.

New Modules:
- Added AdminsUI Module to allow members to easily see the admin list, which also shows alts and status

Removed Modules:
- ao/Team has been removed since the raid interface makes this obsolete.
- ao/Glyph has been removed as it no longer serves a purpose.
- ao/Tier2 has been removed as it no longer serves a purpose.

+Possible BREAKAGE! - Preliminary testing shows modules appear to be working as expected.
+- Moving from Status array to BotError. This WILL cause breakage until the checks have been converted as well.
+- Moving userId/userName cache from AOChat to core/PlayerList.php. Calls to core("chat")->get_u* are now deprecated and PlayerList does return BotError on failures.
+- rosterupdate seems to output alot of errors todo with failed to get whoIs (confirmed by luyu)
 
+Known breakage
+- IRC module fails to process commands given in IRC.
